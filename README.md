# Game-Programming-Sample

Welcome to my game programming course projects repository! This repository showcases a collection of projects and code samples that I developed as part of my course in Game Programming. These projects represent a blend of fundamental programming principles, game mechanics, and some interactive experiences I created to explore various aspects of game development.

About the Projects
Each project in this repository represents a different component or skill of game development, including level design, physics simulation, UI development, and interactive gameplay. They are coded primarily in C++ with some projects utilizing Unreal Engine for 3D graphics and game mechanics. Through these projects, I explored:

Game loops and mechanics: Including character movements, physics, and collision detection.
Object-oriented principles: Designing objects like doors, windows, characters, etc.
Physics-based interactions: Implementing bouncing mechanics, gravity, and friction.
UI/UX Design in Games: Including in-game menus and player feedback elements.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
Game Engine: Unreal Engine
Other Tools: Git for version control, Visual Studio for development

Some Project Descriptions
1. [Project Name: Bouncing Ball Simulation]
Description: A simple physics simulation where a ball bounces off walls within a boundary. It demonstrates collision detection and response.
Skills Used: C++ for logic, Unreal Engine for rendering.
Highlights: Focuses on physics, boundary conditions, and object interactions.
2. [Project Name: Basic 2D Platformer]
Description: A 2D platformer where the player controls a character to navigate through obstacles and reach the end goal.
Skills Used: Game loops, event handling, and sprite animations.
Highlights: Designed character movements, implemented score tracking, and introduced simple enemy AI.

Installation & Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Game-Programming-Projects.git
cd Game-Programming-Projects

Dependencies:
Ensure you have Unreal Engine installed.
For C++ projects, use Visual Studio with the appropriate C++ development kit.
Running the Projects:
Open the project in Unreal Engine or Visual Studio.
Build and run to launch each project individually.
